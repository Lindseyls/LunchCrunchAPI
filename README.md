# Lunch Crunch API
>An iOS app that provides the ability to make informed decisions on choosing a restaurant based on current wait times, total time spent, and proximity.

Please visit the front-end repository for the application to see the full project description:

https://github.com/Lindseyls/LunchCrunch

Lunch Crunch is an application that uses React Native on the front-end and Rails on the back-end.

The back-end is deployed to Heroku to serve data by managing relevant content in a PostgreSQL database and handling Yelp API calls, but it is also ready to be developed as an independent Rails web app.
